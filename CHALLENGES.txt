Thank you for the detailed information! It’s 5:28 PM HKT, June 3, 2025, and we’re making great progress toward finalizing your 7-minute recording for the take-home task. The updates confirm that NGINX is running correctly, the firewall rules for ports 80 and 8000 are in place, and local requests to http://localhost/predict via NGINX work perfectly, returning {"text":"I love this movie!","sentiment":"positive"}. However, the external curl command to http://34.60.182.187:80/predict hangs, and the Google Colab notebook still outputs {'text': '...', 'error': ''} instead of the expected sentiment responses. The NGINX logs show only local requests (127.0.0.1), indicating that external requests aren’t reaching NGINX.

The core issue is that external traffic (from Google Cloud Console, Colab, or elsewhere) to your VM’s IP (34.60.182.187) on port 80 is being blocked or not routed correctly, despite the firewall rules. This explains both the hanging curl and the notebook’s incorrect output. I’ll guide you to diagnose and fix the external access issue, update the Colab notebook, and provide a polished recording plan to meet the task requirements (container for HuggingFace inference, parallel requests with NGINX/Gunicorn/Uvicorn, and a notebook demo)
